## Feature Enhancements
If you feel like you have a suggestion for a change to the way that FSBerry works

## Bug Reports
While it's never great to find a bug, they are a reality of software and 
software development. We can't fix or improve on the things that we don't know
about, so report as many bugs as you can. If you're not sure whether something 
is a bug, file it anyway.

**If you are concerned that your bug publicly presents a security risk to the
users of FSBerry, please contact

## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are the primary method for making changes to FSBerry. GitHub has 
[fantastic documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
on using the pull request feature. FSBerry uses the 'fork-and-pull' model of 
development. It is as described 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/)
and involves people pushing changes to their own fork and creating pull requests
to bring those changes into the main FSBerry repository.

Please make all pull requests against the `master` branch.

Every pull request for FSBerry is reviewed by another person. You'll get a 
reviewer from the core team assigned at random, but feel free to ask for a 
specific person if you've dealt with them in a certain area before. 

Once the reviewer approves your pull request it will be tested by our continuous
integration provider before being merged.
