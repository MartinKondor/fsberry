<h3 align="center">
Free, open source, built by a community, built for everyone.
</h3>

The main mission of this project (FlyingStrawberry or FSBerry), is to create and maintain a social network which is available for everyone, free to use, as secure as possible and built by a community. On the community, we mean both the developers and the users who can recommend different functionalities and/or contribute on FlyingStrawberry.

On the other hand, a social network must have some functions what could make it more useful. Here is the list (not complete) of these yet not implemented functions where you can help us:

* Friend adding, removing and listing on profiles
* Images in posts
* Profile picture change & user settings
* Chat between users & teams
* Organizations & teams
* Searching for users / organizations
* Improve UX
* Host the website
* Translations for the website
* Mobile app

But anyway, if you think you have a great idea for us, just go ahead and write an email: [martinkondor@gmail.com](mailto://martinkondor@gmail.com)
